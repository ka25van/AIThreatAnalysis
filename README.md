Data Collection:
          The system collects network traffic data
          Monitors incoming and outgoing connections
          Logs system events and user activities

Analysis Pipeline:
          Network traffic is analyzed in real-time by the NetworkTrafficAnalyzer
          The ThreatAnalyzer processes this data using AI models
          Anomalies are detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm
          Deep learning models identify potential threats

Visualization Dashboard:
          Real-time metrics display:
          Active threats counter
          Detected anomalies
          Overall traffic health score
          Number of active connections

Interactive time-series graph showing:
          Threat trends over time
          Anomaly patterns
          Traffic patterns

Alert System:
          High-priority threats trigger immediate alerts
          Anomalies are logged and displayed
          Traffic patterns are monitored continuously

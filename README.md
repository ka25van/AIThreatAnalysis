This project is an AI-driven cybersecurity system that detects and logs phishing attacks, network intrusions, and other threats in real time. It consists of:

Frontend (React.js): A dynamic dashboard displaying real-time logs, analytics, and alerts.
Backend (Node.js & Express.js): Manages log storage, processes requests, and integrates AI models.
Machine Learning Model (Python, Scikit-Learn): Detects phishing attacks using text classification (TF-IDF & Random Forest).
Database (MongoDB): Stores threat logs for historical tracking and analysis.

Where It Can Be Used?
This cybersecurity system can be implemented in various domains, such as:
          Corporate Security - Protects organizations from phishing and unauthorized network access.
          Banking & Finance - Safeguards against fraud attempts in online transactions.
